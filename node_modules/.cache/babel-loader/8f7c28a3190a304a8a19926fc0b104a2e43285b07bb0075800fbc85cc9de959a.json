The four squares – Durbar Square, Taumadhi Square, Dattatreya Square, and Pottery Square collectively make up the Bhaktapur Durbar square.

This palace complex is an excellent showcase of Newari architecture and craftsmanship. The courtyard is dotted with a number of Hindu as well as Buddhist monuments.

There are a number of Newar as well as Tibetan Buddhist myths and legends surrounding this amazing stupa’s origin while some records state that it was built by a Licchavi King Sivadeva as far back as the 5th Century CE. In present day, it is one of the largest Buddhist stupas in the world and the whole surrounding area is a Buddhist-populated settlement with over 40 monasteries nearby. A large number of tourists, pilgrims as well as locals visit the Stupa every day, each for their own reasons. Chanting monks, spinning prayer wheels, flocks of pigeons, and the smell of incense are just a few factors that make up the unique atmosphere of this location.</p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n                <img src=\"https://www.adventurehimalayacircuit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Pashupatinath-Temple.jpg\" alt=\"\"></img>\n                <h3>Pasupatinath Temple</h3>\n                <p>Heritage tour in Nepal.

Entry to the main temple is allowed only for Hindus but everyone is free to observe from the hills beside the Bagmati riverbanks.
